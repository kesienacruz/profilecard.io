      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>Hey, I'm Kesiena Cruz — a fullstack developer and technology enthusiast passionate about building innovative solutions that make life easier and more connected. 
        I specialize in backend development, system automation, and digital strategy — crafting reliable, user-focused products that bridge creativity with functionality. 
        I enjoy turning ideas into digital experiences that are simple, scalable, and impactful.
        Beyond coding, I’m deeply involved in community growth and social impact projects, using technology to empower others and create positive change. 
        When I’m not developing or managing digital platforms, you’ll likely find me exploring new tools, mentoring learners, or improving existing systems.
        My goal is to combine technology, creativity, and purpose to build solutions that truly make a difference.</p>
